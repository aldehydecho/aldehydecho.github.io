&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-research-goal&#34;&gt;1. Research Goal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we want to build a planner for multi-robot system, using local and global information and dividing policy decision process into two phases. We want to leverage the power of reinforcement learning, and train the policy in a simulation scenario, instead of using real-word training data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There exist successful decentralized methods [1, 2, 3] based on reinforcement learning to navigate multi-robot system to avoid collision. Decentralized method does not require frequent communication and only uses local observation; However, with improvement of communication and positioning technology, e.g. 5G network and wifi-based indoor positioning system, we can more easily acquire global system status. Meanwhile, centralized system can guarantee safety, completeness, and approximate optimality solution [1]. Thus, in this project, we want to build a system using global information and computation in a simulated environment. To reduce complexity, we also assume the system has no communication latency and has a clear global sensor measurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to formulate global information as a map with each agent’s location. This formulation can fit most of large systems no matter how many agents the system have. Also, we can use sophisticated convolutional neural network (CNN) to process this image-like input, to better understand the running environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot deny that fully-centralized method has some drawbacks compared to fully distributed methods. For example, fully-centralized method computation rely on one central server. The central server may cannot process huge-amount of information, or the system may break down once the central server stopped. Thus, in this project, we want to divide the planner into two phases, i.e. global decision period with global information on central computer and local decision period with each agent’s own observation on its processor. Previous work including [4] shows that this idea could work. We want to combine deep reinforcement learning in this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, our main goal of this research project is to build a multi-robot planner, combining local and global observation and computation power, using deep reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-motivation&#34;&gt;2. Motivation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While humans and animals most of time navigate their lives based on local information, which is obtained through their natural perceptions, the underlying planning process may not yield the optimal result. For example, traffic throughput rarely reaches its theoretical maximum because people tend to change their speed based on local observations and thus causing traffic waves that lead to traffic congestion, as shown in the following video.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Suugn-p5C1M&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we want to investigate, in a multi-robot system, how the overall performance of navigation measured in time could benefit from the extra input of global information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-related-work&#34;&gt;3. Related work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narain et al. present a hybrid representation for large dense crowds with discrete agents using a dual representation both as discrete agents and as a single continuous system. A scalable crowd simulation approach is used, making it possible to simulate very large, dense crowds composed of up to a hundred thousand agents at near-interactive rates on desktop computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fan et al. develop a fully decentralized multi-robot collision avoidance framework, where each robot makes navigation decisions independently without any communication with others. A sensor-level collision avoidance policy that maps raw sensor measurements to an agent’s steering commands in terms of the movement velocity is learned via reinforcement learning. The learned policy is combined with traditional control approaches to further improve policy’s robustness and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim et al. propose a new training method, named message-dropout, yielding efficient learning for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with information exchange with large input dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
